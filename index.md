# Favour Umeh's Portfolio
This portfolio highlights some of the Data Engineering and Data Science projects that I have undergone in 2021

## [Project 1 (Data Engineering): Basketball Reference Data Pipeline](https://github.com/favourumeh/DATA-PIPELINE)
- Created a data pipeline that can scrape and clean tabular statistical data from BasketballReference.com and store it in a local MySQL server and/or Excel workbook. 
- The pipeline was used to store over 16,000 rows of per-game statistics of players in National Basketball Association (NBA) spanning 31 years (from 1990-2021)
- The stored data was then used in several machine learning projects namely regression and classification (see projects 2 and 3)  
- The NBA is the top professional basketball league in North America. It was founded in 1947 and is currently home to the best basketball players in the world. 
- Basketball Reference is an online depository of basketball statistics, game logs etc for different basketball leagues.
