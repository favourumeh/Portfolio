# Favour Umeh's Portfolio
This portfolio highlights some of the Data Engineering and Data Science projects that I have undergone in 2021

## Project 1 (Data Engineering): Basketball Reference Data Pipeline 
- Created a data pipeline that can scrape and clean tabular statistical data from BasketballReference.com and store it in a local MySQL server and/or Excel workbook. 
- The data in question is per-game statistics from the national Basketball Association (NBA) and it will be used to undergo regression and classifcation projects (see projects 2 and 3)
- The NBA is the top professional basketball league in North America. It was founded in 1947 and is currently home to the best basketball players in the world. 
- Basketball Reference is an online depository of basketball statistics, game logs etc for different basketball leagues.
